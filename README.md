For this project, we used the provided data to create 4 new CSV files through Jupyter notebook.
Using the new CSV files, we successfully created a new database in PostgreSQL and imported the data into their corresponding tables.

We used https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/ to create our ERD.

We also referenced stackoverflow and the Xpert learning assistant to help with our coding.
